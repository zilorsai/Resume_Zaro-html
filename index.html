<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    Result-oriented and market-driven are among the top attributes 
    that describe me. I am hardworking and capable of dealing with 
    the flow of paperwork and school duties while remaining efficient 
    in all tasks. My purpose is to understand the root of poverty, inequality,
     and food insecurity and contribute to alleviating food insecurity in Haiti.
      My fieldwork is in agricultural economics, with an increased interest 
      in data analysis and statistical modeling. MSC in Rural Development 
      at Ghent University, with great experience in developing communities, and graduated from the State University of Haiti in Agricultural Economics.
